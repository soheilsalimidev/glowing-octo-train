\section{Data Cleaning And Feature Extraction}
We preprocessed the audio data by first resampling all MP3 files to a uniform 16~kHz sampling rate to ensure consistent spectral representation across recordings. Each clip was then truncated or zero-padded to a fixed duration of 60 seconds, enabling the extraction of fixed-length feature vectors. Finally, we computed 13 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) per frame and summarized them using their mean and standard deviation over time, resulting in a 26-dimensional feature vector per sample. These features were standardized using \texttt{StandardScaler} to have zero mean and unit variance, which is essential for distance-based machine learning algorithms to operate effectively in the presence of heterogeneous feature scales.
